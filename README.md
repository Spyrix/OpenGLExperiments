Just fooling around with OpenGL for an assignment
Number key 1 2 3 4 5 select parts of the object. Arrow keys perform translations & rotations, depending on the object.
Blue axis is Z, green is Y and X is red.
Transformations such as translation across x and Y axis cascade across the parts of the object.
C selects camera and arrow keys move it.
